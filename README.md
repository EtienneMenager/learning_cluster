# learning_cluster
Creation of a teaching cluster as part of a didactic project. 


More and more, solving various problems (meteorology, simulation, etc.) requires large computational resources.
In order to propose solutions to these problems, computer engineers must be trained in high-performance computer 
calculation tools. However, these tools are not always easy to learn and their level of abstraction rebukes more 
than one student.The project carried out by the University of Edinburgh is a project that takes its place within 
the framework of computer education. It is about offering a fun model to learn parallel programming using an 
attractive support. This project has inspired more than one university, including the University of Rennes 1 and 
the "ENS de Rennes", which have also decided to propose their own model. These different documents present a feedback 
of the experiment carried out on this idea. It is divided into two parts (a hardware part and a software part) and 
scans the different choices that have been made throughout this work.

Several folders are present in this directory: a text document presenting the choices made and the list of materials used; 
a folder containing the CAD of the maquette; computer files to create the network of the maquette (TO BE COMPLETED).
